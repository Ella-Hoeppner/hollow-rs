## to-do
* make several demos
  * simple purefrag, basically the current thing
  * simple cyclic orbit thingy with vertex shaders, with vertex buffer data set from cpu
  * simple compute shader example, could do a pickover attractor or something, maybe copy from 
* purefrag shader abstraction
* support multiple windows
* writing to textures
* compute shader passes
