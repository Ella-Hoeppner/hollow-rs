## to-do
* abstract away boilerplate in constructing wgpu objects
  * shaders
  * buffers
  * bind groups
  * pipelines
  * render passes
* rather than having to instantiate shader objects, the user should just be able to pass in shader source strings
* support writing to textures
* purefrag shader abstraction
